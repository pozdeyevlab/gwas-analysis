MissingOutputException in rule format_matrix in file "/Users/whitesa3/Desktop/gwas-analysis/five-fold-prs-validation/Snakefile", line 132:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
example_output/prscs_five_fold_matrix.tsv (missing locally, parent dir contents: prscs_delong_input.tsv, manual_five_fold_raw.tsv, prscs_five_fold_raw.log, prscs_five_fold_raw.tsv, prscs_five_fold_matrix.log, manual_delong_input.tsv, manual_five_fold_raw.log)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
